          There are a total of 26 women only member organizations (international and national). There are around 5 million college students and alumnae that are part of Panhel. These organizations fundraise and also volunteer for many worthy causes such as fighting for body-positivity and leading bystander intervention programs. Other causes include any issues that are faced on specific college campuses. Although there are 26 organizations, there are only three offered at RPI. The names of the three are Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Phi, and Pi Beta Phi. These are the only women-only sororities at RPI, but there are other organizations that are co-ed. Click on the following links to learn more about them! </p>
