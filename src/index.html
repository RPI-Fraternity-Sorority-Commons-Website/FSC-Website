      <h2><u>About Us</u></h2>
      </p>
      <p>Welcome to the dynamic and active world of Greek life at Rensselaer! This site
        is meant to give you the opportunity to learn more about our different organizations on campus,
        so you can begin to consider if Greek life is right for you or your student.
      </p>
      <p>At the center of our community is the Fraternity and Soroity Commons.
        Our council plays a vital role in shaping your Greek life experience. Tasked with
        planning community events, programs, and representing our community as a whole, they
        ensure a positive and enriching experience for all members.

      <p>Our social organizations fall under one of three councils, including the Interfraternity Council (IFC),

        Soroity and Fraternity Council, and Panhellenic Counil (Panhel). In addition to these we also have several
        professional
        organizations on campus.
