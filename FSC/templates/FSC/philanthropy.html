<!-- Todo: 
  This page should have a table for community service hours for the current semester AND a table for philanthropy funds raised in the current semester.
  To determine the "current semester" on startup, there should be a function to check the date and return what semester/year it would correlate to.
  There should then be 2 dropdown menus to help user's filter the tables. The first should be a "groups" dropdown, which lets users toggle between
  "All organizations", "IFC", "Panhel", "MSFC", and "Professional Orgs". The second should be a "semester" dropdown, which lets users toggle between
  all available semesters in the database dropdown menu. When used in conjunction, these dropdowns should determine which semester and group to show
  on BOTH leaderboards (yes, leaderboards show every possible org in the group, and yes, both leaderboards would be changed upon the dropdown menu changes).
  Finally, since they are leaderboards, we will need to find a way to sort the entries from greatest to lowest community service hours OR philanthropy funds
  raised in the given semester -->

  <script>
    function getSeasonWithYear() {
        const now = new Date();  // Get the current date
        const currentMonth = now.getMonth();  // Get the current month (0-11)
        const currentYear = now.getFullYear();  // Get the current year
        let season = '';
        // Check if the month is between January (0) and August (7), inclusive
        if (currentMonth >= 0 && currentMonth <= 7) {
            season = "Spring ";
        } 
        // Otherwise, it's between September (8) and December (11), inclusive
        else {
            season = "Fall ";
        }
        // Return the season and the current year
        return season + currentYear;
    }

    // Example usage to dynamically set the semester on page load
    window.onload = function() {
        const currentSemester = getSeasonWithYear();
        document.getElementById("current-semester").innerText = currentSemester;
