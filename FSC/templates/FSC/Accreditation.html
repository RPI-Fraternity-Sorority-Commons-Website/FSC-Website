        <h3>1.6: Scholarship and Academic Support</h3>
        <p>
            Each chapter is required to have a designated scholarship/academic chairperson who manages academic initiatives.

        <h3>2.5: Chapter Advisor Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            Chapters must maintain an active relationship with a primary Chapter Advisor who provides guidance, supports recruitment efforts, 
            and completes biannual reports. Advisors are essential to chapter success and must also attend at least one in-person FSC meeting annually.
