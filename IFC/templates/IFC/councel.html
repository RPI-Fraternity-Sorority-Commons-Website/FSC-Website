      <h1>Council</h1>
      <p>A council is a group of fraternities and/or sororities that work together to support a common mission and vision. These organizations are often grouped by affinity, history, or goals. Each council is overseen by a council advisor—a Fraternity and Sorority Commons staff member—and a team of student leaders who serve as the council executive board.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Governing Councils</h2>
      <p>At Rensselaer, three Governing Councils—Interfraternity Council (IFC), Multicultural Sorority & Fraternity Council (MSFC), and Rensselaer Panhellenic Council—serve as pillars of guidance, oversight, and direction for our 29 active organizations. Additionally, the Professional Fraternities/Sororities community, encompassing three more organizations, provides a unique space for professional development and growth.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>John Cohen, President of the Interfraternity Council, oversees the IFC’s mission of fostering brotherhood and collaboration among its member fraternities.</li>
        <li>Vic Webb, President of the Multicultural Sorority & Fraternity Council, champions inclusivity and cultural awareness within our community.</li>
        <li>Lillian Hendry, President of the Rensselaer Panhellenic Council, advocates for sisterhood, scholarship, and service among our sorority members.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These leaders, alongside their executive boards, work tirelessly to enhance the fraternity and sorority experience for all.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Opportunities within Councils</h2>
      <p>Within this diverse tapestry of organizations, students benefit from leadership development, self-governance, and the freedom to shape their unique experiences at Rensselaer. Join us in celebrating the spirit of camaraderie, growth, and excellence within our flourishing fraternity and sorority community!</p>
