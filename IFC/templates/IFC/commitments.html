                <p>
                    As the Office of Fraternity & Sorority Commons (FSC), our foundation rests upon four distinct commitments: 
                    Support, Inform, Develop, and Engage. Aligned with these commitments, we wholeheartedly champion the fraternity 
                    and sorority community's five core values: academic excellence, civic and community engagement, diversity and 
                    inclusion, health and wellness, and personal growth and development. Guided by these commitments, the FSC 
                    diligently crafts programming, education, and access initiatives that seamlessly integrate into our annual 
                    calendar. These carefully designed programs and events are a testament to our unwavering dedication to empower 
                    and uplift our governing councils, member organizations, and their members as they work towards upholding the 
                    essence of our community's five core values.
