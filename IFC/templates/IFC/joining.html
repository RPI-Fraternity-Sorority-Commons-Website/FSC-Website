    <h1>How to Join!</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Joining a fraternity or sorority is a personal choice that can sometimes feel overwhelming. To help ease this process and support better decision-making, we encourage all interested students (potential new members) to learn about the organizations and ask questions about recruitment, intake, and what membership entails.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Institutional Eligibility Criteria</h2>
      <p>Rensselaer operates under a "deferred recruitment" policy, meaning students are eligible to join a social fraternity or sorority only from their second semester onward. Transfer students who have earned 12 transferable credit hours from another institution may join immediately. Regardless of the timing, candidates must meet these requirements before they can begin the recruitment or intake process:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Eligibility Requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete a minimum of 12 credit hours.</li>
        <li>Maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 2.5 or the organization’s required GPA, whichever is higher.</li>
        <li>Transfer students need a cumulative GPA of 2.5 from their previous institution and 12 transferable credits.</li>
        <li>First-year January admits are eligible starting the following fall semester.</li>
        <li>Be in good standing with the university conduct process and not on probation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">Note: An exception is granted for our gender-inclusive fraternity within the Professional Fraternity/Sorority community, allowing membership for first-year students without a university-established GPA.</p>

      <h3>IFC Recruitment</h3>
      <p>The Interfraternity Council (IFC) comprises 22 member chapters. Potential new members may join through formal recruitment in the spring or an informal process in both spring and fall. Formal recruitment is scheduled for January 19 – February 1, 2023.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>MSFC Intake/Recruitment</h3>
      <p>The Multicultural Sorority & Fraternity Council (MSFC) includes six intercultural organizations affiliated with national councils like NAPA, NALFO, and NPHC. These groups host informational sessions each semester, though reaching out to individual chapters or attending events is the best way to gather more details on their recruitment practices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>RPC Recruitment</h3>
      <p>The Panhellenic Council consists of four chapters: three NPC chapters and one associate organization. Recruitment can be through the formal spring process or informal, ongoing recruitment (Continuous Open Bidding) in the fall. The main recruitment period is typically held in late January.</p>
      <p>RPI Panhellenic’s primary recruitment is set for January 14 – 19, 2025. For more details, stay tuned on Instagram or contact us at <a href="mailto:rpi.panhel.vpr@gmail.com">rpi.panhel.vpr@gmail.com</a>. We’re excited to welcome you into our community!</p>

              All Greek organizations are working examples of a democracy in action. This is often the first time that members are responsible for managing their own activities and living within their means, so joining a fraternity or sorority provides an excellent opportunity to experience leadership and the responsibility of membership. In addition, the chapters are more than clubs; they are corporations, often with large budgets managed by the members.

              One of the most mentioned aspects of fraternity and sorority life is the friendship that exists between members of a chapter, among both its undergraduates and alumni/ae. Fraternity and sorority life promotes the development of close ties between members through living, studying, working, competing, and having fun together. These lifetime relationships go beyond ordinary friendship to become like that of a family.

              Greek letter organizations are self-sufficient, with each chapter collecting dues and membership fees to support their own activities and programs. For chapters with houses, charges include room, board, and fees which may vary depending on whether the member lives in or out of the chapter house. While students should ask about a chapter's fees while going through recruitment, Greek living is generally comparable to non-Greek on-campus living costs, and in many cases is less expensive.

              The social aspects of Greek-letter organizations help to make college more than just a school. Greeks often organize various social activities including picnics and barbecues, faculty dinners, formals, parties, and trips to local attractions. All chapters have risk management procedures for social events which help to provide a safe environment for members and guests during chapter functions.

              Chapter housing facilities vary greatly in size and amenities. Some groups live in Rensselaer residence halls or renovated apartments; others in houses owned and operated by the chapters themselves. Actual living arrangements vary from chapter to chapter as to how many members reside in the house and share bedrooms. Chapters with their own houses commonly run their own meal plans, either with a paid cook or members preparing meals themselves. All chapters that provide housing facilities for students are inspected twice a year to ensure compliance with fire and building codes.

              Academics are important in Greek Life and are stressed by chapters from rush to graduation. The resources that Greeks often provide include scholarship awards, study sessions, files of materials, and tutoring assistance. Many chapters and national Greek organizations recognize and reward members for their scholastic excellence. According to Institute retention data, members of Greek organizations are more likely to complete their Rensselaer degree than their non-Greek counterparts.

              Philanthropy is part of Rensselaer's fraternity and sorority community. Each semester, the Greeks at Rensselaer raise thousands of dollars and donate hundreds of hours to worthy causes. For example, chapters donate blood, raise money for various charitable causes, serve as Big Brothers and Sisters to Troy children, and help Neighborhood Associations clean and beautify their streets.

              Greek alumni/ae play a major role in advising chapters. Each chapter has at least one adviser, but often many more, and housing corporation members to help with day-to-day operations. They meet regularly as members of the Alumni Inter-Greek Council, which provides networking and resources for efficient chapter management.
